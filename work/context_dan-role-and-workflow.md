Updated: 2026-02-05

## Who / Role
- Dan is the **leader of a dev team**.

## Core responsibilities
1) **Intake requests & bugs** from users
   - Primary channels: **Zalo** and **Outlook email**.
2) **Analyze + break down** requests into tasks
   - Clarify requirements, define acceptance criteria.
   - Delegate tasks to developers.
3) **Guide the team’s execution**
   - Provide implementation direction and coding guidance.
   - Create/maintain shared code scaffolds/frameworks for the team.
4) **Code review + some hands-on coding**
   - Review PRs, enforce conventions/quality.
5) **Progress & communication**
   - Track and update work progress.
   - Update docs/todos/project wiki.
   - Receive calls from manager (Anh Tuấn) during the day to:
     - Report status
     - Sync on system changes
     - Discuss technical decisions

## Near-term plan / resourcing
- May onboard **Anh Hiếu** as a part-time freelancer (~**15 hours/week**) to help.

## Personal growth goals
- Improve typing
- Improve English
- Learn market/finance/investing

## Guiding principle
- Goal: **automate as much work as possible**.
- Prefer working **systematically, logically, focused**, and **time-efficient**.

## Problems to solve (implicit)
- Intake is fragmented (Zalo + email + calls).
- Context is scattered across chats, docs, PRs.
- Need a repeatable system for: triage → delegation → tracking → reporting → knowledge capture.
